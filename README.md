## üìç Overview
Unicorn-web is a bun based web framework which makes the process of creating a web application much simpler. It provides core HTTP entities to simplify and standardize the HTTP requests handling operations by offering a convenient way to setup a server, define routes and extract relevant information from the requests. It aims to be a fast, highly customizable and scalable web framework that helps you in your daily tasks, providing common functionality abstractions, improve code readability and maintainability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîß Installation

```sh
bun add unicorn.web
```

### ü§ñ Building your first unicorn.app

Let's create your first unicorn.app

1. Open your `index.ts` and creates a new server instance:
```ts
import { UnicornServer } from 'unicorn.web'

const server = new UnicornServer();
```

2. Add some routers to fetch requests:
```ts
import { UnicornServer } from 'unicorn.web'

const server = new UnicornServer();
server.get('foo', () => new Response('foo'));
server.post('boo', (ctx) => new Response(`Hi, ${ctx.body.name}`));
```

3. Serve the application in a port of your choice:
```ts
import { UnicornServer } from 'unicorn.web'

const server = new UnicornServer();
server.get('foo', () => new Response('foo'));
server.post('boo', (ctx) => new Response(`Hi, ${ctx.body.name}`));
server.serve(3000);
```

4. Start the server
```sh
bun run index.ts
```

Just four lines and you have a working web application. Now, your app is running at `http://localhost` in the port you previously setup. If you make get requests for `http://localhost:3000/foo` it will receive `foo` back and if you make post requests for `http://localhost:3000/boo` you receive `Hi` and the name you sent in the body back.
